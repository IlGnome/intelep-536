Congratulations. If you are reading this file then your modem driver should be
installed properly. Remember to reboot with the proper kernel if the driver was
not able to be loaded.



-Quick Info

Your Modem should be accessible from both these locations:
   /dev/537
   /dev/modem



-Connecting to the internet

Right click on your panel bar(at the top or bottom of the screen)
Click "Add to Panel..."
Select "Modem Monitor" from the icons
Click "Add"
Click "Close"
Right-click on the new modem icon
Click "Properties"
Check "Enable this connection"



-Getting Gnome-ppp

Gnome-ppp seems to be a better program for dialing, but it is not 
installed by default. To download this program:
   sudo apt-get install gnome-ppp -y

Then you will need to configure it. (You may need to logout, then login)
   Applications -> Internet -> GNOME PPP
      Type in your Username, Password, and dialup Phone number.
      Click Setup button
         Under the 'Modem' tab
            Device: /dev/537   (or /dev/modem)
            Type: choose Analogue modem
            Speed: 115200 or lower
            Phone Line: Tone
            Volume: High
            Wait for dialtone: checked
         Under the 'Networking' tab
            Leave Dynamic IP Address and Automatic DNS both enabled
         Under the 'Options' tab
            Abort connecting if no dialtone: checked
            Check carrier line: checked
            Check default route: checked
