Congratulations. If you are reading this file then your modem driver should be
installed properly. Remember to reboot with the proper kernel if the driver was
not able to be loaded.



-Quick Info

Your Modem should be accessible from both these locations:
   /dev/536ep0
   /dev/modem

Some of the commands in this file are run from a terminal. You can begin
a terminal session by going here:
   Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal



-Connecting to the internet

To connect to the internet for the first time, you will need to use the program
wvdial. Open a terminal and type in the following.
   sudo cp /usr/share/doc/intel536ep-lucid/wvdial.conf /etc/wvdial.conf
   sudo nano /etc/wvdial.conf
      Put your USERNAME, PASSWORD, and dialup PHONENUMBER in the appropriate
            areas of the /etc/wvdial.conf file.
      Press Ctrl-X, save the file and exit the editor.
   wvdial



-Getting Gnome-ppp

For connecting to the internet in the future, you will probably want to use the
graphical program gnome-ppp. First you will need to download this program.
   sudo apt-get install gnome-ppp -y

Then you will need to configure it. (You may need to logout, then login)
   Applications -> Internet -> GNOME PPP
      Type in your Username, Password, and dialup Phone number.
      Click Setup button
         Under the 'Modem' tab
            Device: /dev/536ep0   (or /dev/modem)
            Type: choose Analogue modem
            Speed: 115200 or lower
            Phone Line: Tone
            Volume: High
            Wait for dialtone: checked
         Under the 'Networking' tab
            Leave Dynamic IP Address and Automatic DNS both enabled
         Under the 'Options' tab
            Abort connecting if no dialtone: checked
            Check carrier line: checked
            Check default route: checked
            Ignore terminal strings(stupid mode): checked
   Close and reopen Gnome-ppp
   Connect
